1️⃣ 📁 node_modules/
Contains all installed dependencies & third-party libraries.
Automatically managed by package.json.
Should not be modified manually.
If deleted, it can be restored using npm install.

2️⃣ 📁 public/

Files here are served directly by the browser without being processed by Vite.
Good for storing external assets that don’t need to be bundled with JavaScript.
